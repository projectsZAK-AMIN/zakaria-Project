           <h2 id="zika" >How to invest money:The smart way to make (Money Grow!)</h2>


<p> You may be thinking to yourself – this is not the time to talk about investing.
You’re panicking about your job, that argument with your best friend, your cat behaving even more weirdly than usual – and don’t even get me started on your love life.

But really, there’s NO GOOD time to talk about investing. Ultimately, you have to be disciplined enough to hold onto the money you earn – to then take the next step in learning how to make your money grow.

And the best way to grow your money is by learning how to invest.

It’s as simple as that.

When you become an investor, you’ll be using your money to acquire things that offer the potential for profitable returns through one or more of the following:                                                          </p>

<ul class="zak" >
	<li>
	Interest and dividends from savings or dividend-paying stocks and bonds.

	<li>
		Cash flow from businesses or real estate.
     <li>
		Appreciation of value from a stock portfolio, real estate, or other assets.
    </li>
	</li>	
    </li>

</ul>


<p class="hh">
	
As you learn to become an investor, you will begin to devote your limited resources to the things with the largest potential for returns. That may be paying down debt, going back to school, or fixing up a two-family house.

Of course, it may also mean buying stocks and bonds, or at least mutual funds or exchange-traded funds.

Thanks to advances in technology, you can start to invest with as little as $5 a month and a smartphone. It’s our job to help you filter out the noise, learn the basics, and make good investment decisions from the start.
